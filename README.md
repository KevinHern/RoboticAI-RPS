In this repository, you will find the source code of the game logic.
The computer is in charge of handling the scores and executing the AI that
maps the player's gesture into Rock, Paper or Scissors.

The computer will also generate log files to keep track down the set, scores and the overall
state of the game.

However, due to GitHub's store limit, the AI file has been uploaded in [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_atlSnL-9MbQCBmg1HxLD0CYNs8gUApW/view?usp=sharing)
